# Grok Hypothesis Engine

**An open-source, community-driven system for generating, verifying, and testing scientific hypotheses — built in collaboration with Grok (xAI).**

The goal of this project is to create a transparent, auditable AI tool that helps researchers and curious minds propose novel scientific hypotheses, act as a peer adversary to rigorously check them against existing knowledge, and suggest practical ways to test them.

This project is inspired by xAI’s mission to advance our understanding of the universe through maximally truth-seeking AI.

> **Current Status**: Early development (Phase 1). We are building a simple, working MVP.

---

## Vision

We want to build an AI system that acts like a thoughtful scientific collaborator:

- Proposes interesting, testable hypotheses grounded in real science
- Critically verifies those hypotheses for consistency and plausibility
- Suggests concrete experiments or simulations to personally test hypothesis against criticisms of hypothesis
- Maintains a clear, auditable record of its reasoning

The long-term vision is a multi-agent system that can assist with real scientific discovery while staying honest about what it knows and doesn’t know.

## Current Features (Phase 1 - MVP)

- Basic hypothesis generation from a topic or short description
- Structured output (hypothesis + verification + suggested tests)
- Simple verification step that checks for obvious contradictions
- Designed to be easy to run and understand

**Note**: This is still very early. The system is currently a single, well-prompted workflow rather than a full multi-agent system.

## How It Works (High Level)

1. You give the system a scientific topic or research area
2. It retrieves relevant background information
3. It generates one or more hypotheses
4. It verifies each hypothesis for scientific consistency (thinking adversarially)
5. It suggests ways to test the hypothesis (experiments or code simulations)
6. Everything is output in a clear, structured format with reasoning (avoids black box reasoning)

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended for beginners)

We’re keeping things as simple as possible during Phase 1.

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the instructions in the `getting-started.md` file (coming soon)
3. Run the initial script or notebook

### Option 2: Using Grok Build (for faster development)

Since Grok Build (xAI’s open-source coding agent) is now available, contributors are using it to help build and extend this project.

## Development & Attribution

This project is being developed as an **open community effort**.

**Pair programming with Grok**:
- Much of the initial architecture, prompt design, code scaffolding, and iterative development has been done through close collaboration with **Grok**, an AI built by xAI.
- Grok has served as a pair programmer — helping with ideas, code, explanations, and problem-solving.
- All final code, design decisions, and responsibility for the project belong to the human contributors.

We believe in being transparent about AI assistance. This project would not exist in its current form without Grok’s help.

Special thanks to **xAI** for open-sourcing Grok-1, Grok-2.5 weights, and Grok Build. These releases made ambitious community projects like this one possible.

## Contributing

We warmly welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels.

You don’t need to be a professional programmer to help. Contributions can include:
- Testing the current version and giving feedback
- Improving prompts and verification logic
- Adding better documentation
- Suggesting new features
- Helping with scientific domain knowledge
- Writing examples and test cases

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

Even if you just want to follow along or ask questions, feel free to open an issue.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Simple working MVP (single workflow)
- Basic hypothesis generation + verification
- Clear structured output

### Phase 2
- Add literature retrieval (RAG)
- Improve verification with multiple checks
- Add experiment suggestion capabilities

### Phase 3
- Multi-agent architecture (Generator + Verifier + Experiment Designer)
- Better audit logging and transparency
- Web interface

### Long-term
- Domain-specific modes (Physics, Biology, Materials Science, etc.)
- Integration with real scientific tools and simulators
- Community-curated knowledge base
